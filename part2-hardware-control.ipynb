    "Pycromanager has some limitations and saves data into a weird file format that doesn't work with `tifffile` (see this github [issue](https://github.com/micro-manager/NDTiffStorage/issues/12)). However it has documentation which is a significant plus.\n",
    "\n",
    "`pymmcore` is much more performant than `pycromanager` and offers far more detailed control of the scope. However, the documentation is essentially non-existant:\n",
    "\n",
    "> We do not currently have Python-specific documentation for CMMCore. The C++ documentation is the best resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite those limitations both options allow for full featured control of microscope from python which opens the door to lots of exciting options:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Live analysis scripts that adapt the acquistion you are running\n",
    "    - Could follow a cell in XY \n",
    "    - Use world class Neural Nets to do software autofocus\n",
    "2. Easiest way to integrate external instrumentation into a multidimensional acquisition\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ian combined a traditional `BF` + `GFP` MDA with acuiring Raman spectra of single cells with the laser aiming system built through Python. This is a great example of one of Python's strengths of acting as `glue` between languages and programs.\n",

    "### General Instrumentation\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no general solution here - every instrument will have it's own idiosyncracies and you will absolutely need to read the documentation provided by the manufacturer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For better or worse Serial communication is still the lingua franca of many scientific instruments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Hope that the manufacturer has published documentation\n",
    "2. Read that documentation\n",
    "3. Make wrapper an convenience classes\n",
