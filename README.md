# NESM Python Workshop
Notebooks for the python workshop at the New England Society for Microscopy Spring 2021 Meeting


### Proposed Schedule

#### Morning (~2 hours)

***Part 1*** Python essentials
- Jupyter lab vs scripting
- For loops
- Functions and objects (?)
- Numpy
 - Vectorized operations (e.g. max projection)
 - Indexing and broadcasting (possible example something like background subtraction?)
 - Numpy for image data
- Pandas (?)
- Xarray (?)
- Exercise - 


***Part 2*** Image analysis and I/O
- Intro to the nightmare of I/O
- skimage
- Frame-wise operations with `np.vectorize`
- napari 

#### Afternoon (~2 hours)

***Part 3*** Mini discussion of hardware control?
- In the spirit of less is more maybe we should spend the whole morning
on python essentials and move part 2 to the afternoon? Feels like you can never have enough? But also who
knows what the experience level of this audience will be compared to undergrads...

***Part 4*** Advanced topics to explore

- Dask and big data
- Sklearn (NMF example and/or PCA on SRS beads data)
- Deep learning (Basically show off YeaZ unet?)
- Other GPU stuff
